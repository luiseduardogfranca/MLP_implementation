# Breast Cancer classification with Neural Network Artifical 

### What is Neural Network?
Artificial neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brain. 

### Neural Network with structure MLP - Multi Layer Perceptron
* Neurons number on input layer: 4
* Neurons number on hidden layer: 50
* Neurons number on input layer: 2
* Acttivation function: LeakyReLU (on hidden layer) and Sigmoid (output layer)
* Learning rate: 0.00003
